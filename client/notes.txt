useEffect: gets data from an external source and then gets it ready to render on the app


line 97: creates id
line 119: passes in as props


As far as cantrips and spells go for rendering: now the names appear, but they're not connected to the spells or cantrips tables. they don't reference anything. 
    I wasn't sure how to get the spell_id that's common between the spells and the junction table to connect to the name on the spells table, so I entered them manually. that makes the existence of a spell_id on that table currently kind of useless

    But also when someone is entering a spell, it's more useful to use the name anyway: no one on the front end will have access to an id


I want to drill down into the spellbooks_spells object enough to get spellbook_id off of it, I think


CYPRESS TESTING

-wrap individual components in browserRouter
-import at the top; wrap inside the cy.mount()
-cy.get('h1').should('have.value', 'Login')

--Connecting Token to Front End--
middleware functin: request.setHeader() to create the header on the object for token passing
-create a function above our routing 
(requireToken): it's a middleware function that takes req, res, and next
-if the token is in the req.header, pull it from there: call the user object; set the value of req.user or whatever to be that user's data; call next, pass the request to the middleware function; call the middleware; pass it into the route handler as a callback function, and access it that way; the middleware function runs before the route. the data gets abstracted into the request so that it'll be in the response

RENDERING INDIVIDUAL USER INFO
-access current token
-inside a useEffect:
    async function getSpellbookId
        const response = await getCharacterByUsername(username)
        const result = await response.json();

-I want to pull the spellbook_id ... but one isn't assigned at login? So maybe the char_id becomes the only key that's needed for spellbooks.

New tables:
Chars_spells junction table
Chars_cantrips junction table

Nix:
-arcane recovery
-spellbooks
-spellbooks_spells
-spellbooks_cantrips
