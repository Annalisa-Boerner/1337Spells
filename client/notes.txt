useEffect: gets data from an external source and then gets it ready to render on the app

there's a delete api route in junction_spellbooks for one table row; now I need to connect it to where things rae rendering and add it to a button

line 97: creates id
line 119: passes in as props


As far as cantrips and spells go for rendering: now the names appear, but they're not connected to the spells or cantrips tables. they don't reference anything. 
    I wasn't sure how to get the spell_id that's common between the spells and the junction table to connect to the name on the spells table, so I entered them manually. that makes the existence of a spell_id on that table currently kind of useless

    But also when someone is entering a spell, it's more useful to use the name anyway: no one on the front end will have access to an id


I want to drill down into the spellbooks_spells object enough to get spellbook_id off of it, I think
