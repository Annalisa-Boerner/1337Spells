what I want to do:

the information stored in "spells known" is an array of spell_ids for l1 spells; the info stored in "cantrips known" is an array of cantrip_ids

or maybe they're not arrays, maybe they need a through table:
many spellbooks can contain the same spell
many spells can belong to the same spellbook

-created two through tables:
    -spellbooks_spells
    -spellbooks_cantrips

1. make these tables in the seed.js createTables
1a. adjust the spellbook to have nothing in it
1b. make sure everything in plural
2. make helper functions
3. make and populate them in seedData
    a. figure out how this interacts with the other seed data
